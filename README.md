# XRPL Hooks

This is a placeholder. The XRP Ledger Hooks source code & tooling will live here in the future.

This will be a monorepo, with (not definitive yet):

- `/xrpld` - Rippled (xrpld) source with Hooks support
- `/sdk/ts` - Typescript/Javascript SDK / ..
- `/ide` - What youâ€™re working on
- `/samples` - Sample hooks
- / etc.
